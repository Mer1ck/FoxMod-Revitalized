# FoxMod-Revitalized
Original mod created by BismuthBorealis.
Sprites borrowed and edited from MSX++ UnDeadPeopleEdition, and the "Alternate Ear Graphics" mod.
Currently built for CDDA Experimental (as of April 11th)

Active develompment is taking a pause in favor of my new "Japanese Folklore" mod, which includes all of what this mod has to offer and (eventually) much more. Please check it out!
